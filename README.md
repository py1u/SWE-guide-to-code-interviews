# Software Engineering: Preparing For the Coding Interview 2021-2022

### A guide on the progression of thinking like a software developer from start to finish. Exploring easy, medium, and hard level coding interview questions from the top tech companies.

### By Peter Lu and Mellie Mariano

#### Our Introductions:

Hello name is Peter, I am a Data Science and Applied Physics double major w/ a minor in Business @ UC Riverside planning to graduate in spring 2024 and pursue my Masters in Artificial Intelligence @ Nanyang Technological University in Spring 2025. The reason Mellie and I created this guide/book was to provide UCR students with advice on cracking the code interviews that they would experience when applying for software engineering positions. My hobbies include reading books, watching movies, playing basketball, and skateboarding!

Hi my name is Mellie, I am a Computer Science and Cognitive Sciences double major @ UC Irvine hoping to graduate in spring 2024. I plan to pursue my masters in my forth year at UCI. Peter and I created this guide because we wanted to help UCR students gain the skills nessesary to succeed in coding interviews from a guide that would provide our own coding journey from seperate universities. I enjoy ice skating, skateboarding, and watching anime!

# Part1: Software Engineering: What? Where? Why? 
published on: Decmeber 1st, 2021

## Introduction: 

If you are reading this, that means you have already realized that you want to become a **software engineer**. Maybe you have dreamed of it. Hoping to land a internship,or better yet, a fully paid entry level position as a software engineer. Great! Let me explain.

As a software engineer or SWE for short, you will be leading the world in new technology and innovation that is constantly changing in a rapidly evolving marketplace. Doesn't that sound exciting? **YES!!! YOU SHOULD BE EXCITED!** If not, **YOU SOON WILL BE!** 

Even with a degree in computer science, you will set yourself on a promising and fufilling career too. Becoming a **product manager** or **consultant** are great alternatives that have a lot of value in tech companies. You can mange programming projects and manage product solutions with less code if you never felt strong in coding but wanted to still work alongside expert programmers.

The skys the limit with a computer science degree and there are so many unique jobs in tech waiting for you to discover, BUT for now we will focus on software engineer roles in technology. Lets explore the What, Where, and Why.

1. What is Software Engineering? (the longest part)

    It many definitions, many of which are similar and have different interpretations for everybody. But I will provide a thoughtful quote from Titus Winters, a Principle Software Engineer(now Ex Googler in 2024) with over 13 years of experience at Google. He is notably known for devloping the Google C++ Style Guide at Google. He states, "Software engineering is programming integrated over time". For students that are from UCR, its nice to mention that Titus Winters was a UCR alumni who graduated with a PhD in Computer Science.
    If you are wondering where I got his quote,you can read his first chapter of his book *Software Engineering At Google* [here](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/software-engineering-at/9781492082781/ch01.html)
    
    Yes programming and being able to program fluently is a important trait of being a software engineer, but its important to understand that *programming languages are simply tools* and the **real* skill and maybe *talent* as a software engineer is **learning**** and knowing **how** to make use of these tools effectively to solve problems and produce software solutions that can remain useable for a **long long time**. 
    
    A prime example of a software solution that remains useable for a long time is no better example than the search engine giant itself: Google Search. Founded in 1998 in Menlo Park,CA Google's search engine still remains the worlds most popular with over 3.5 billion searches per day and 1.2 trillion searches per year worldwide[^1]. Part of googles success is not only in providing a well developed search engine has a solution to surfing the interest but also remaining useable for such a long time. 

2. Where is Software Engineering?

    Everywhere! Software engineering and its applications and solutions can be found in just about every piece of technology you could imagine. From your favorite social media app, laptop video game, television, speaker, car, plane, train and so much more, at some point a software engineer was called to develop the software within a product.   


3. Why do Software Engineering?

    Because there is always a need for people in software engineering and to fulfill roles as software engineers. Even with the emerging AI trends like OpenAI's GPT model rumored to go public in Q4:2022(October - December of 2022), the demand for software engineers continues to grow and widely remains the most popular job role for computer science new grads and undergraduate internships. Let me provide a overview of software engineering in 2022.

    - Take a look at the highest paying jobs in Software Engineering Roles:

    - Take a look at the most popular locations for Software Engineers! My tip: **go to the Bay Area!* It is a hotspot and continues to grow bigger every year:

    - Take a look at the market trends for company revenue generated through software products:

I hope this helps you get a better idea of software engineering and the promising career you can have as a software engineer. Don't worry about the common hype of AI and that it will take over the jobs of software engineers. Maybe it will in the future but at the same time, AI is still developed by humans, those humans being software engineers! Point is, software engineering is a excellent field to get into as a computer science student and I would regard it as the most exciting job to start with if you are not sure where to go after getting your bachelors in computer science and any CS related major. Is it competitive? most definitely but that is why this guide was created, to help you prepare for the coding interviews which will be the ultimate goal of this book.
