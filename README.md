## Introduction
### Introducing Ourselves:

Hello! My name is Peter, I am a Data Science + Business double major @ UC Riverside planning to graduate in spring 2024 and pursue my Masters in Artificial Intelligence @ Nanyang Technological University in Spring 2025. Mellie and I created this guide/book was to provide UCR students with advice on cracking the code interviews that they would experience when applying for software engineering positions. My hobbies include reading books, watching movies, playing basketball, and skateboarding!

Hi, my name is Mellie, I am a Computer Science + Cognitive Sciences double major @ UC Irvine hoping to graduate in spring 2024. I plan to pursue my masters in my fourth year at UCI. Peter and I created this guide because we wanted to help UCR students gain the skills necessary to succeed in coding interviews. We also wanted a unique guide that would provide our own coding journey from separate universities. I enjoy ice skating, skateboarding, and watching anime!

### Our Motivation:

We wanted to document our coding journey from the beginning of summer 2021. Mellie has strengths in Agile programming and DevOps and Peter has strengths in mathematics and computational theory, and together these students decided to create a guide that would prepare students to succeed in coding interviews where university coursework fails to prepare them for. Throughout this guide, you will see our own progression in coding and understanding software development. This allowed us to put together a guide which would best reflect how a student from UCR would experience during their undergrad as a Computer Science student. By designing our guide that builds your skills from begginer to advanced following the progression of programming from introductory courses to upper divison projects, this would provided the best way to teach students and keep them engaged. 

Our goal is not to teach you how to code because we believe you would be taking introductory courses and developing the skill along the way anyway. Instead we want to teach you how to *think* like a software engineer and apply this thinking to write code that is *clean*, meaningful*, and *effective* outside of a classroom and in real world applications in the industry. Much of the coding techniques we want to cover will reflect common industry trends and we will go down to the very fundementals of programming that all great programmers must know. We hope to finish this guide by the fall of 2022. By the end of this guide, you should have fluency in C++ or Python from the CS10,12,14 series, and confidence coding medium to hard level technical interview problems. Better yet you will be able to write code that sets you apart in coding interviews and impress your interviewer and friends. Dont settle with being just good at programming, **be a programmer with great habits**

### Before Getting Started: Software Engineering: What? Where? Why? 
Decmeber 1st, 2021

If you are reading this, that means you have already realized that you want to become a software engineer. Maybe you have dreamed of it. Hoping to land an internship, or better yet, a fully paid entry-level position as a software engineer. Great! Let me explain.

As a software engineer or SWE for short, you will be leading the world in new technology and innovation that is constantly changing in a rapidly evolving marketplace. Doesn't that sound exciting? YES!!! YOU SHOULD BE EXCITED! If not, YOU SOON WILL BE!

Even with a degree in computer science, you will set yourself on a promising and fulfilling career too. Becoming a product manager or consultant are great alternatives that have a lot of value in tech companies. You can manage programming projects and manage product solutions with less code if you never felt strong in coding but still want to work alongside expert programmers.

The sky is the limit with a computer science degree and there are so many unique jobs in tech waiting for you to discover, BUT for now, we will focus on software engineer roles in technology. Let's explore the What, Where, and Why.

1. What is Software Engineering? (the longest part)

    It has many definitions, many of which are similar and have different interpretations for everybody. But I will provide a thoughtful quote from Titus Winters, a Principle Software Engineer(now Ex-Googler in 2024) with over 13 years of experience at Google. He is notably known for developing the Google C++ Style Guide at Google. He states, "Software engineering is programming integrated over time". For students that are from UCR, it's nice to mention that Titus Winters was a UCR alumni who graduated with a Ph.D. in Computer Science. If you are wondering where I got his quote, you can read the first chapter of his book: "Software Engineering At Google"
   
    Yes programming and being able to program fluently is an important trait of being a software engineer, but it's important to understand that programming languages are simply tools, and the real skill and maybe talent as a software engineer is learning* and knowing how to make use of these tools effectively to solve problems and produce software solutions that can remain useable for a long long time.
   
    A prime example of a software solution that remains useable for a long time is no better example than the search engine giant itself: Google Search. Founded in 1998 in Menlo Park, CA Google's search engine still remains the world's most popular with over 3.5 billion searches per day and 1.2 trillion searches per year worldwide1. Part of Google's success is not only in providing a well-developed search engine that has a solution to surfing the interest but also in remaining useable for such a long time.

3. Where is software engineering used?

    Everywhere! Software engineering and its applications and solutions can be found in just about every piece of technology you could imagine. From your favorite social media app, laptop video game, television, speaker, car, plane, train and so much more, at some point, a software engineer was called to develop the software within a product. The most popular industry that most students and probably you go into is the tech industry, notably FAANG companies. Some non tech related industries include medical and pharmaceudtical, banking and investment, military and government agencies. Theres always a place for software engineers and most importantly a place for you!  


4. Why do Software Engineering?

    Because there is always a need for people in software engineering to fulfill roles as software engineers. Even with the emerging AI trends like OpenAI's GPT model rumored to go public in Q4:2022(October - December of 2022), the demand for software engineers continues to grow and widely remains the most popular job role for computer science new grads and undergraduate internships. While there is a common sterotype that software engineers stare at their screenall day and drink redbull, this is not entirely true. Noted, there probably are some people out there like that but know that it really isnt as stressful as it seems. If anything, it is fun because you have a lot of flexibility like working from home and not having to fight the traffic if you are lucky. There is also so so room for learning as a software engineer. Whether you are a year 1 or year 10 SWE, you never stop learning. To work with some of the smartest people on the Earth who are willing to help you grow and mature while being a part of techological innovation should be eye opening. Of course, with hardwork, it comes with a nice paycheck too!

Before we finish this introduction chapter, Let us provide an overview of software engineering in 2022.

- Take a look at the highest paying jobs in Software Engineering Roles:

I would also like to share a set of quotes from the top tech CEOs that share their perspectives and philosophies on being a Software Engineer. Hopefully you find one that inspires you!

"Software is a great combination between artistry and engineering."
*Bill Gates (Microsoft)*

"You never lose a dream; it just incubates as a hobby."
*Larry Page (Alphabet/Google)*


"Our industry does not respect tradition — it only respects innovation."
*Satya Nadella (Microsoft)*


"In the old world, you devoted 30% of your time to building a great service and 70% of your time to shouting about it. In the new world, that inverts."
*Jeff Bezos (Amazon)*


"In technology, it's not about patents, trademarks, or processes. It's about people."
*Tim Cook (Apple)*


"You get paid in direct proportion to the difficulty of problems you solve."
*Elon Musk (Tesla, SpaceX)*


"The biggest risk is not taking any risk. In a world that's changing quickly, the only strategy that is guaranteed to fail is not taking risks."
*Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook/Meta)*

I hope this helps you get a better idea of software engineering and the promising career you can have as a software engineer. Don't worry about the common hype of AI and that it will take over the jobs of software engineers. Maybe it will in the future but at the same time, AI is still developed by humans, those humans being software engineers! Point is, software engineering is a excellent field to get into as a computer science student and I would regard it as the most exciting job to start with if you are not sure where to go after getting your bachelors in computer science and any CS related major. Is it competitive? most definitely but that is why this guide was created, to help you prepare for the coding interviews which will be the ultimate goal of this book.

## Chapter 1: The Art of Clean Code

### Purpose: 
To show you why simply being good at programming is not enough. Everyone can be considered a good programmer. Why be like everyone else? You must build great habits that will make you a *great* programmer. 

### Motivation:
This chapter is designed to explore what it means to write clean code. This means naming conventions, code spacing, readability, and organized action.
